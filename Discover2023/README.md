This is the folder for products that I made as a result of my fourth-place finish at UTA's Discover Symposium 2023. I am honored to have been selected in the top 5 undergraduates, and I will certainly continue this project in an effort to further science even more.

A video explaining this project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL5vEjOPHGI).
